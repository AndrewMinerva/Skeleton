# Skeleton
Skeleton Mesh

1. Multi-arm IK. Two arms with 3 joints and an end effector each.  Both arms reach for the object and are connected by a central root that does not move and one shared root that allows for the skeleton to lean.
2. Joint limits, the shoulders and wrists of the skeleton possess joint limits that restrict the potential angle of movement.
3. User Interaction, the user can control the camera and objective in the 3D version while the 2D version allows for movement of the skeleton.
4. Moving IK, the Ik is able to move in the 2D version.
5. 3D Rendering and camera, camera is controled easily by the user in a well lit and clear 3D environment.
